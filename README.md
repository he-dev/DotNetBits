# Reusable v3.70.0

`Reusable` is a collection of gereral purpose libraries that I use in many of my other projects. Their main purpose is to support **DRY**. I don't like writing the same code over and over. So if anything looks like it could be reused somewhere else I put it here.

The solution has undergone a huge clean-up and now contains only code that I think is ready for production and I use it as such. Not every part is covered with tests yet but step by step it will.

_(Currently the only project that is still being developed and not ready is the `CommandLine`)_
