# Reusable v2.27.3

`Reusable` is a collection of gereral purpose libraries that I use in my other projects.

## Components

- [`Reusable.Core`](https://github.com/he-dev/Reusable/blob/master/Reusable.Core/README.md) - This library provides the most common utilities.
- `Reusable.ConfigWhiz` - This is the new _smarter_ SmartConfig.
- `Reusable.Colin` - This is a command line interface.
- `Reusable.ConsoleColorizer` - This is for easier console styling via xml.
- `Reusable.TypeConversion` - This is for easier and extendable type conversion.
- `Reusable.Fuse` - This is for consistent and fluent inline validation and verification.
- `Reusable.Logging.NLog.Tools` - This is for easier `NLog` configuration.
- `Reusable.Markup` - This is for creating html/xml markup.
- `Reusable.SemanticVersion` - This is for working with semantic versions.
