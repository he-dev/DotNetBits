# Reusable v1

`Reusable` is a collection of libraries that I use in my other projects.

I didn't want to write the same things over and over agian so I put them in separate projects ready for reuse.

It contains the following parts:

- `Reusable.Data` for easier data access.
- `Reusable.Drawing.Color32` for a _better_ color structure.
- `Reusable.Logging.NLogExtensions` for easier `NLog` configuration.
- `Reusable.Markup.MakrupBuilder` for easier dynamic html/xml creation.
- `Reusable.Collections` for more powerful collections.
- `Reusable.ConsoleColorizer` for easier console styling via xml.
- `Reusable.CronExpression` for parsing cron expressions (experimental).
- `Reusable.Extensions` for various `string`, `Type` and other extensions.
- `Reusable.FluentValidation` for fluent inline validation and for easier testing.
- `Reusable.Formatter` for easier and extendable string formatting.
- `Reusable.SemanticVersion` for working with semantic versions.
- `Reusable.TypeConversion` for easier and extendable type conversion.
